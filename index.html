            <p>Sometimes when we are angry we feel as though we don’t want to talk to the person we are mad at. For example when Shusterman says “He presses his pen to a fresh page and writes, Dear Mom and Dad.… It’s five minutes before he can come up with another line, but once he does, the words start flowing—and in strange directions, too. At first it’s angry, as he knew it would be. How could you? Why did you? What kind of people could do this to their kid? Yet by the third page it mellows. It becomes about all the good things that happened in their lives together. At first he does it to hurt them, and to remind them exactly what they’ve thrown away when they signed the order to unwind him. But then it becomes all about remembering—or more to the point, getting them to remember, so that when he’s gone… if he’s gone, there will be a record of all the things he felt were worth keeping alive.” (Shusterman 109). He shows that after escaping from his parents, at first Connor felt as though he doesn’t have anything to say to his parents but after he starts writing he can stop until he has basically poured his heart out to them. This quote reminds me of the old days when mail had to be delivered through the Pony Express and there was a high chance that mail could get lost in the process of delivery and the recipient could never know that someone was trying to contact him whereas now when you send an email 99.9% of the time it will send within less than 2 minutes of sending it.

        <div class="p1">
            <p>One of the things I enjoyed about Unwind by Neal Shusterman is that the author builds up tons of suspense causing me to never want to put the book down. One type of reader I think would enjoy this book are people who like to leave the world and dive into a mystery world when reading. One of the moments of suspense I enjoyed was when Shusterman wrote 'With his face already swelling from the crazy kid’s brutal punch, Pastor Dan says with a hiss and strange warble to his voice, “Run, Lev!” Lev wasn’t expecting this. “What?” “Run! Run as fast and as far as you can. RUN!”' Why was his spiritual father telling him to run away from his parents? I thought to myself as I was walking to my next class. Another moment when the suspense was going to kill me was when Shusterman wrote "Connor tries to make himself move, but can’t. It’s because of the baby. Because of the way it wails. This is not the same baby! Connor tells himself. Don’t be stupid. Not now!" After reading this part my brain could not stop thinking "What was Connor going to do?" and "was Connor going to take the baby and take of it or was he going to leave it?" Also, a final moment of suspense I wan to talk about is the part where Shusterman writes about the letter Connor is writing to his parents and whether or not he is going to survive until he turns 18 and whether or not he is going to deliver the note to his parents if he makes it to 18.
